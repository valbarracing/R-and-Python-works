# REPORT Nº1

Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our lives and on the perception of our own situation. This can be seen in WHP+ report, which have a double objective: in addition to measure happiness and to track the COVID-19’s impact on people’s well-being, the report emphasizes the importance of institutional and social trust in happiness’s stability and low death rates.

On one hand, about pandemic’s impact, global life evaluations have shown remarkable resilience. Although the average of negative emotions (such as sadness or worry) has increased and the frequency of positive emotions has fallen, no significant change has been seen in general evaluations of life and, consequently, happiness has remained stable.

On the other hand, the report concludes that trust is the key factor linking happiness and pandemic control. It’s not a coincidence that countries with high trust levels had lower death rate. Given that these societies have greater trust among themselves and in public institutions, the zero-transmission strategy was well accepted and executed. Thus, these countries not only managed to save more lives and supported happy lives, but, contrary to expectations, had bigger growth rates for GDP.

In line with the above, do macroeconomic indicators such as GDP help to measure happiness or well-being? From my perspective, not completely. It’s evident that GDP helps to understand countries general economic situation and how it changes over time. Even could be said that while GDP is higher, the country will be “richer” and its population will be happier.

However, it is not so. As Acemoglu, Laibson and List argue “GDP and national income accounting is a useful system for taking the temperature of the economy […] [but] it necessarily leaves out a lot of details”. GDP, in addition to ignoring key aspects for measuring the economy, does not explain how country’s income is distributed among population. Consequently, its value as a measure of social welfare is quite limited, as it does not really contemplate what happens within each society.

For instance, WHR+ uses income as a variable that supports happiness, but the same report shows how countries with lower income inequality tend to present greater institutional trust, that leads to better strategies for limiting the spread of the pandemic, saving lives and having happier societies. In this sense, a country can have high GDP and, at the same time, be extremely unequal (due to the concentration of wealth) and have low well-being indices. Or, even worse, by ignoring negative externalities or considering them as positive contributions to GDP, greater economic growth can be achieved at the expense of the well-being of many.

Even indices such as the WHR+, which despite considering various social aspects, does not end up encompassing the particularities of each country. The report acknowledges that, on the one hand, some populations that were already worse off and have been most affected by the pandemic (those living in elder care, hospitals, prisons, and most of those living on the streets and in refugee camps), are not included in the surveys; on the other, the shift from face-to-face interviews to cell phone surveys, cover mostly people living inside high income gated communities and not those who have no access to telecommunications.

Finally, although is partially true that in less unequal societies well-being is higher and strategies to deal with crises are more effective, reducing income inequality will not cause an automatic advance in well-being and happiness. Beyond the monetary and statistical aspect of GDP, people with the same income level can achieve different levels of well-being due to the existence of structural injustices. Income is obviously an important mean for people's well-being, but does not capture all its fundamental aspects: discrimination, gender gaps and social prejudices have crucial impact on people's well-being and development. In this sense, the WHR+ emphasizes the importance of quality of relationships in happiness levels, considering income, health, someone to count on, freedom, generosity, and trust as the six factors supporting well-being.
