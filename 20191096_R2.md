1.	What is the research question of the article? 

Waldinger’s research focus on answering if faculty quality has an effect on PhD student outcomes.

2.	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to responding to that question?

On one hand, I consider that the research’s strengths are linked with the use of the dismissal of Jewish and politically unreliable professors as an exogenous variation in university quality and with the checks indicating that Waldinger findings are very robust.

The fact that more motivated and talented students usually select high quality universities or the difficulty to measure laboratory quality, among others, make the estimation of causal effect on PhD student’s outcomes complicated. Nevertheless, the research overlaps these problems interestingly: the comparison between affected and unaffected mathematics departments, have shown how PhD student outcomes deteriorate after the dismissal of high-quality professors.

Hence, knowing that quality of training matters on PhD student’s outcomes, Waldinger focused on possible situations that bias the result. He does not only deepen on statistical considerations, but in the current German situation: adding individual controls as the disrupted of student life and its consequences, the loss of a particular advisor, the department-specific trends or the dismissals of Jewish students. 

On another hand, I consider that the weaknesses are related with the way to measure professor’s productivity, university quality and PhD student’s outcome variables. Waldinger himself points it out when argues that “it is particularly challenging to construct quality measures that reflect the aspects of university quality that truly matters for PhD students”. However, in my opinion, the research generates conclusions just focusing on the academic field, not in the practical. 

The 4 outcome variables for PhD students (publish dissertation in a top journal, become a full professor, number of lifetime citations and number of positive lifetime citations), the productivity measures for professors (based on articles in top academic journals and number of subsequent citations of these articles) and the department quality measures (calculated as the average of the professors individual productivity measure), evidence the academic bias. ¿What if excellent PhD programs are not just focused on academic production? ¿What about careers, not only basic sciences as mathematics, with fieldwork? Or ¿What if an overstanding student do not decide to work in the Academia? ¿He or she will not be considered in the “positive” outcomes?

3.	How does this document advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and the referees decided to publish the article).

From my perspective, the research contributes to answering if university quality has an effect of PhD student’s outcomes in two ways: First, it’s interesting that Waldinger not only focused on measuring faculty/university quality based on the nearest outcome, dissertation, but short- and long-term PhD student’s outcomes. Second, the results had led Waldinger to suggest an interesting way of organizing PhD training that, in his words, “should be further encouraged by science policy makers”. Starting from the realization that high-quality PhD programs have important effects on PhD students and comparing the past and actual situation of German PhD programs, the solution for an efficient way of training PhD students should be designing large PhD programs in a small number of very high-quality departments.

4.	What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?

First, in line with the above, could be interesting to analyze other countries that use or have universities with the suggest PhD model, large programs in few high-quality departments, especially in not highly selective education markets. But not only for basic sciences careers, but other ones as social sciences, humanities or arts. Second, linked with the answer for part 2, a more complete analysis could be achieved if not just focus variables that reflect academic outcomes, as number of positive citations or articles in top journals, but in work field or non-academic production.
