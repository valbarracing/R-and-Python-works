The paper aims at responding why the pace of entrepreneurship in the US have been declined. The authors decided to focus on this startup declining tendence and the consequent decreasing role of young businesses because of its relation with the becoming less dynamic US business and economy.

In this line, the apparent trends evidence a diminish in the incentives for entrepreneurs to star new firms in US, which the paper tries to identify. Nevertheless, before analyzing the decline in the startup rate and business dynamism, the authors followed a series of steps with the purpose of understand the complexity of entrepreneurship and avoid possible misleading. It’s there where research’s strength lies. 

First, as there is not a particular category for “entrepreneurship” in available data, the paper made important distinctions: not only explains why every research of this topic should focus on “new businesses” and “new firms” categories, but that “transformational entrepreneurs” type are the ones that impact on job creation and productivity growth.  

Second, the authors tried to fully understand the real impact of startups to US economy exploring their post-entry dynamics. The last affirmation could imply that every entrepreneurship makes long-lasting contribution to job creation, but there is just one type: the vast majority of startups fail or, if survive, don’t growth; but, among the surviving, are high-growth young firms that contribute disproportionately to net job growth.

Therefore, although the research tries to understand the causes of the decline in the startup rate and business dynamism in US, does not provide a clear and full answer. Quite contrary, the use of “changing distribution of firm age” and “changing industrial structure of firm activity” as independent variables, just give partial conclusions about its impact on the change in job reallocation. What’s more, the answers were quite expected and, from this report’s perspective, followed a circular logic. For instance, affirmations as  “because rates of job creation and destruction are much higher at young firms, these changes will contribute to the decline in both job creation and job destruction rates” seemed obvious after reading half of the paper, or “these findings suggest that unexplained within-group variation must account for most of the observed decline in job flows” just don’t give clear answers. 

Nevertheless, it does not mean that the research is not useful; conversely, the authors, even if couldn’t explain the causes of the declining pace of entrepreneurship, have made important advances in order to advance knowledge about the question. Thanks to their additional research, now it is known that “there are some common factors that are not sector- or region-specific accounting for the decline in entrepreneurial activity”. In this line, the contribution of the paper is linked to the opening of new and future research lines with a solid base of the complexity of entrepreneurship: the authors not only bring up the possible impacts of idiosyncratic shocks (as technological change and globalization), but a bunch of alternative explanations that should be explored.
